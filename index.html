				<h2>Python</h2>
				<p>Im mostly developing in Python, HTML and JSS. Basicly learnig is a life long process and i'm still trying to grasp it.</p>
				<p>github supports hosting of static pages to tell a bit more about your projects and repos.</p>
				<p>This is an excellent idea to tell more about your repo for people who dont normally code.</p>

				<h2>Home assistant</h2>
				<p>Im spending some time with home assistant since it does keep my electric bill way smaller than it would be other wise.</p>
				<p>Weather hub or mobile alerts as it's also is knowed for is a thermometer that works very well with H/A.</p>
				<p>If you like to use my version of it you need to tell H/A to use a tailored repo and then link it there.</p>
